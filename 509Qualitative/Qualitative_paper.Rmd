###Introduction

In this paper, I will focus on a debate about whether the separate cultural layers in Kiwulan (KWL) site belong to the same prehistoric ethnic group. The KWL site is located at Ilan city and near a riverside at the northern margin of the Ilan plain. The site was excavated during 2001 to 2003 by the Department of Anthropology of National Taiwan University (Chen 2007). According to the archaeological remains, the site can be divided into a lower cultural layer and an upper cultural layer, dating from 1300B.P. to 800B.P. and 600B.P. to 100B.P., respectively, based on radiocarbon dates. However, there is a debate about whether the archaeological remains from both layers belong to the same culture or not. Chen (2004) argues that these two layers belong to the same culture based on similar pattern of artifacts. However, Chiu states that they belong to different culture or ethnic group due to the distinct style of mortuary practice. The following will further examine these two explanations.  

###Archaeological evidence 

Chen focuses on the similar archaeological remains in both layers. In both layer, we can find similar burial goods, such as glass beads, agate beads, and metal bell. In addition, the pattern of pottery in both layers shows the similar surface treatment, stamped decoration. 
Chiu stresses the difference between these two layers based on mortuary practice. The common burial in lower cultural layer is secondary; however, most burials in upper cultural layer are primary and the bodies are in flexed position. 

###Links between evidence and behavior
The same culture hypothesis is based on the similar human practice on daily life, such as making pattery.
Different culture hypothesis thinks that mortury parctice reflects the worldview of a ethnic group, which is the core element in a cultue and seldom change with time. 
###Behavior at different scales 

###Discussion
1. Context of the monograph’s explanatory model
2. Relevant philosophy of science
3. Critique
