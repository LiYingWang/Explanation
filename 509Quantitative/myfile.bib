  title = {Apprenticeship, cultural transmission and the evolution of cultural traditions in historic New England gravestones},
  abstract = {Cultural evolutionary models that relate spatial and temporal patterning in artifact sequences to human social learning processes and history have made many recent advances. Specifically, these models connect evolutionary forces and social leaning mechanisms along cultural pathways with expectations that can be assessed using material culture. In this dissertation, I use an historical archaeology case study of carved New England gravestones to evaluate three different aspects of cultural transmission and artifact patterns. First, I study the role of social network structure in the transmission of cultural information among carvers organized in workshops that were principally comprised of a carver and his apprentices. The results of this study suggest that the motifs reflect widespread similarity that transcends workshop organization. However, the finer grained decorative elements that make up these motifs correspond with cultural lineages of gravestone carvers. Second, I examine the relationship between the diffusion of innovations and cultural transmission mechanisms that result in spatiotemporal patterning. The spatial patterning suggests that social contagion among consumers created brief instances of wave-like diffusion from a distinct workshop, highlighting the role of consumer choice. A review of probate payments shows that gravestones were rarely purchased from distance sources, as transport costs could be prohibitive. The spatial patterning and historic record suggest that carvers also learned from other carvers creating a hierarchical diffusion process. These two populations created a feedback mechanism that leads to complex emergent phenomena, as illustrated by the rapid and widespread adoption of the cherub motif. Third, the neutral model of stylistic variation is applied to gravestone data to examine the ways that increased consumption and an expanding carving industry led to dominant decorative motifs. This study shows that neutrality can be a fleeting and transitional state between the dominance of single decorative styles. These three studies use New England gravestones to illustrate the evolutionary forces and cultural transmission mechanisms among artifact producers and consumers, which generated the stylistic patterning we observe in the archaeological record.},

Beginning with the Late Archaic period, copper artifacts appear in Delaware Valley region collections. Previous trade and exchange models explaining their presence in this region have not adequately defined or explained these models quantitatively. In order to test these exchange models an assemblage of Late Archaic to Early Woodland Delaware Valley copper artifacts were analyzed using laser ablation. In comparing artifacts with known native copper sources from New Jersey, Pennsylvania and the Midwest probable provenance can be assigned. In "fingerprinting" copper artifacts within archaeological contexts from the Delaware Valley, it becomes possible to identify models of trade and exchange and human social systems behind them. This paper attempts to explain types of trade and the development of social complexity through a shift in copper exploitation in the Delaware Valley and Middle Atlantic region.},

Investigation of bone tools from the Chiggerville, Read, and Baker sites in the Green River region of western Kentucky has resulted in the identification of four distinct methods of manufacturing single-piece fishhooks. Additionally, small pointed implements may represent the barbs of composite fishhooks, indicating the use of a technologically distinct fifth style. These fishhook types are interpreted as evidence for the movement of individuals throughout the mid-South in the process of social interaction and exchange and support the hypothesis that Shell Mound Archaic groups in western Kentucky were complex hunter-gatherers.},

In this article, the authors engage the discussion surrounding the meta-theoretical positions on the tempo of change, specifically whether states emerged gradually from quantitative changes in chiefdom societies—gradualism—or if their appearance was the result of punctuated and qualitative change—punctuated equilibrium. After revisiting the classic debate, the authors update it with new contributions drawn from the natural and social sciences. They contend that chiefdoms do not simply become states as a result of increases in the size of component parts; instead, punctuated equilibrium, stemming from responses to selection pressures from social forces, has more empirical support than gradualism in explaining state formation. The authors then take steps toward an integrative model of polity evolution, in which the state emerges as a discrete change resulting from social forces reaching critical thresholds.},

Four factors are basic to understanding the emergence of stratification in prehistoric Korea, around 2300–1700 B.P.: autonomous sociocultural evolution within the peninsula since early Chulmun Period, external pressures from more advanced culture spheres in Manchuria and northern China, the existence of elites able to facilitate integrative process, and warfare and conflict. The external pressures, in particular, resulted in a sociocultural process characterized as a secondary formation. For the evidence of emerging social complexity and stratification, the authors examine various archaeological data, with a special focus on differentiated mortuary architecture and its associated objects. Ancient Chinese accounts are considered as complementary evidence.},

  abstract = {Abstract This article examines evidence for external influences on developing Mycenaean architecture, specifically at Pylos, during the Middle to Late Bronze Age. Previous investigation suggests that emerging mainland elites eclectically appropriated foreign material cultural forms, styles, and techniques into established local traditions, most likely for use in localized prestige competition. Although a wealth of previous scholarship has convincingly demonstrated an extensive Minoan impact on the Greek mainland, less work has been done to provide a context for the mechanisms whereby such influence occurred. Considering architecture as a reflection of social structure and employing a dual-processual theoretical framework, we explore the possibility that architectural similarities and differences between Crete and Messenia are material manifestations of varying exclusionary and corporate strategies of sociopolitical power. We subject the Minoan influence at Pylos to a cross-cultural comparison with the Teotihuacano impact on the development of lowland Maya architectural styles and cultural projects in the Mesoamerican Early Classic period. We also discuss what these two case studies teach us about the relationship between interaction, architecture, and social organization in emergent complex societies, in both the Old World and the New World.},

  abstract = {In a series of publications, Prentiss et al. (2003, 2005, 2007, 2008) have argued for a very late, abrupt, and brief emergence of large villages and large corporate residences in the mid-Fraser region of British Columbia ( 1600-800 cal B.P.) and an even later abrupt emergence of socioeconomic complexity ( 1200-800 cal B.P.). They postulate that climatic changes were responsible for both of these events as well as the collapse of the large villages. We question their interpretations on several grounds including: inappropriate methods for dating these developments; data from Keatley Creek indicating a longer developmental trajectory; incomplete interpretation of paleoclimate trends for the region; and internal contradictions in their own climate-driven explanations for changes. The combined evidence of geochronology and paleoecology (some not previously considered) together with archaeological evidence favors an interpretation of earlier emergence of large villages and socioeconomic complexity than suggested by Prentiss et al. (2003, 2005, 2007, 2008). Dans une série d'articles, Prentiss et al. (2003, 2005, 2007, 2008) ont proposé que les grands villages et les grandes résidences de la partie centrale du fleuve Fraser (en Colombie Britannique) se sont formés assez tardivement dans la préhistoire (c. 1600-800 cal B.P.) et n'ont duré que quelques siècles. Selon eux l'inégalité socioéconomique s'est développée encore plus tard (c. 1200-800 cal B.P). Prentiss et al. suggèrent que les changements climatiques seraient a l'origine de ces événements ainsi que de la disparition des grands villages. Nous doutons de leurs conclusions sur plusieurs plans: des méthodes inappropriées pour déterminer la date de ces événements; des données provenant du site Keatley Creek qui indiquent un développement de plus longue durée; des interprétations paléoclimatiques qui sont incomplètes; et des contradictions au sein de leurs explications climatiques pour les changements culturels. Les preuves géochronologiques et paléoécologiques (comprenant des données jamais considérées auparavant) combinées aux preuves archéologiques favorisent l'interprétation du développement des grands villages et témoignent d'une complexité socioéconomique bien antérieure à celle envisagée par Prentiss et al. (2003, 2005, 2007,2008).},

Documentary sources indicate that there was extensive change in socio-political institutions, economic relations, and other aspects of Gold Coast society in the centuries following the advent of European trade in the late fifteenth century. Archaeological survey and excavation of some 30 structures at Elmina similarly indicates a great deal of change in construction technology and material culture during the post-European contact period. However, examination of artefact patterning and associations indicates that in certain respects there was little change in terms of people's shared world view and belief systems. This picture can be contrasted with data from sites in other areas which may have experienced a great deal of culture change during the post-European contact period. /// Cet article examine brièvement les conséquences de la présence européenne sur la Côte de l'Or, se penchant plus particulièrement sur les données archéologiques, ethnographiques et historiques du site d'Elmina au Ghana. Les sources documentaires indiquent qu'un changement de grande envergure affectant les institutions socio-politiques, les relations économiques et d'autres aspects de la société de la Côte de l'Or pris place durant les siècles suivant l'arrivée du commerce européen à la fin du quinzième siècle. Un survey archéologique et les fouilles d'environ 30 structures à Elmina, indiquent aussi qu'un changement étendu des techniques de construction et de la culture matérielle s'effectue après la période de contact européen. Toutefois, l'étude de la distribution et des associations des objets, indique que le système de croyance et l'idée du monde partagée par cette société furent peu affectés. Cette image peut être comparée avec les données obtenues sur d'autres sites ayant fait l'expérience d'un changement culturel important pendant la période postérieure aux contacts européens.},

This article examines the conceptual foundation of archaeological “culture contact” studies by sharpening the terminological and interpretive distinction between “contact” and “colonialism.” The conflation of these two terms, and thereby realms of historical experience, has proven detrimental to archaeologists’ attempts to understand indigenous and colonial histories. In light of this predicament, the article tackles three problems with treating colonialism as culture contact: (1) emphasizing short-term encounters rather than long-term entanglements, which ignores the process and heterogeneous forms of colonialism and the multifaceted ways that indigenous people experienced them; (2) downplaying the severity of interaction and the radically different levels of political power, which does little to reveal how Native people negotiated complex social terrain but does much to distance “contact” studies from what should be a related research focus in the archaeology of African enslavement and diaspora; and (3) privileging predefined cultural traits over creative or creolized cultural products, which loses sight of the ways that social agents lived their daily lives and that material culture can reveal, as much as hide, the subtleties of cultural change and continuity.},

After the fourth century, the adoption of subcontinental traditions-religious iconography, Sanskrit terminology, coinage, and terms identifying leaders-is seen throughout the area of Southeast Asia, from Bangladesh to Cambodia, Malaysia and Thailand as well as the larger Indonesian islands. Subcontinental traditions became attractive at this time because of the advent of strong political entities in the Indian subcontinent, notably the Guptas, which produced coherent models of political, social and religious organization. Although such models were also available from neighboring China, apprehension about Chinese expansion led the rulers of emergent chiefdoms in Southeast Asia to prefer the adoption of Indian political and religious iconography.},

Some indigenous and other rural groups who interact closely with a given resource system seem to have developed practices that are adapted to live with complexity. This paper examines how indigenous Cree hunters in James Bay, subarctic Canada, understand and deal with ecological complexity and dynamics, and how their understanding of uncertainty and variability shape subsistence activities. The focus is the Canada goose (Branta canadensis) hunt which is adaptive to shifts and changes in local and regional conditions. Ecological understandings of Cree hunters allow them to account for and deal with a very large number of variables at multiples scales. The Cree deal with these variables qualitatively, an approach consistent with some scientific ways of dealing with complexity, such as adaptive management and fuzzy logic.},

In this article, the authors engage the discussion surrounding the meta-theoretical positions on the tempo of change, specifically whether states emerged gradually from quantitative changes in chiefdom societies—gradualism—or if their appearance was the result of punctuated and qualitative change—punctuated equilibrium. After revisiting the classic debate, the authors update it with new contributions drawn from the natural and social sciences. They contend that chiefdoms do not simply become states as a result of increases in the size of component parts; instead, punctuated equilibrium, stemming from responses to selection pressures from social forces, has more empirical support than gradualism in explaining state formation. The authors then take steps toward an integrative model of polity evolution, in which the state emerges as a discrete change resulting from social forces reaching critical thresholds.},

Beginning with the Late Archaic period, copper artifacts appear in Delaware Valley region collections. Previous trade and exchange models explaining their presence in this region have not adequately defined or explained these models quantitatively. In order to test these exchange models an assemblage of Late Archaic to Early Woodland Delaware Valley copper artifacts were analyzed using laser ablation. In comparing artifacts with known native copper sources from New Jersey, Pennsylvania and the Midwest probable provenance can be assigned. In "fingerprinting" copper artifacts within archaeological contexts from the Delaware Valley, it becomes possible to identify models of trade and exchange and human social systems behind them. This paper attempts to explain types of trade and the development of social complexity through a shift in copper exploitation in the Delaware Valley and Middle Atlantic region.},

  title = {Hunter-gatherer economic complexity and “population pressure”: A cross-cultural analysis},
  volume = {7},
  abstract = {This paper examines the relaionship between “population pressure” and socioeconomic complexity among hunter-gatherers. Population pressure is defined as the ratio between population density and the density of available resources. Socioeconomic complexity is measured by means of several correlated variables: storage-dependence, sedentism, social inequality, and use of a medium of exchange. Correlations between these variables are calculated from an ethnographic sample of 94 hunter-gatherer groups. The correlations between population pressure and socioeconomic complexity are found to be extremely high. Two major types of hunter-gatherers exist which are distinguished by a number of variables and may be termed “simple” and “complex.” Transitional groups between these two types are quite rare. It is also noted that population pressure does not arise in continental climates where famine mortality is common because of high-amplitude changes in productivity from year to year. It is argued that population pressure is a necessary and sufficient condition for and the efficient cause of socioeconomic complexity. The widespread disavowal by archaeologists of population pressure as a possible explanation for the prehistoric development of complex hunter-gatherers has no basis in ethnographic fact.

Complex social systems, compared with simple social systems, are those in which individuals frequently interact in many different contexts with many different individuals, and often repeatedly interact with many of the same individuals in networks over time. Complex communicative systems, compared with simple communicative systems, are those that contain a large number of structurally and functionally distinct elements or possess a high amount of bits of information. Here, we describe some of the historical arguments that led to the social complexity hypothesis, and review evidence in support of the hypothesis. We discuss social complexity as a driver of communication and possible causal factor in human language origins. Finally, we discuss some of the key current limitations to the social complexity hypothesis—the lack of tests against alternative hypotheses for communicative complexity and evidence corroborating the hypothesis from modalities other than the vocal signalling channel.},

Four case studies illustrate the use of archaeological artifacts to reconstruct social structures. They include ceramic objects from Mesopotamian colonists in fourth-millennium Anatolia; the Greek influence on early Iberian sculpture and language; the influence of architecture on the West African coast; and settlements across Punic Sardinia that indicate the blending of cultures. The remaining essays look at the roles myth, ritual, and religion played in forming colonial identities. In particular, they discuss the cultural middle ground established among Greeks and Etruscans; clothing as an instrument of European colonialism in nineteenth-century Oceania; sixteenth-century Andean urban planning and kinship relations; and the Dutch East India Company settlement at the Cape of Good Hope"–Publisher's description.},

Self-organized critical systems are large, interactive systems that organize into a critical state where minor events can trigger chain reactions. Such systems demonstrate power-law distributions in the size of changes, or "avalanches," that occur. The theory of self-organized criticality is important in that it implies that the evolution of complex systems may be driven more by interactions between agents than by external events or natural selection. Stylistic changes may be examples of avalanches of interconnected events. Evidence for self-organized criticality is shown for stylistic evolution in historical pottery styles from New York State and is used to evaluate the nature of a prehistoric pottery typology from the Southwest.},

  volume = {7},
  abstract = {This paper examines the relaionship between “population pressure” and socioeconomic complexity among hunter-gatherers. Population pressure is defined as the ratio between population density and the density of available resources. Socioeconomic complexity is measured by means of several correlated variables: storage-dependence, sedentism, social inequality, and use of a medium of exchange. Correlations between these variables are calculated from an ethnographic sample of 94 hunter-gatherer groups. The correlations between population pressure and socioeconomic complexity are found to be extremely high. Two major types of hunter-gatherers exist which are distinguished by a number of variables and may be termed “simple” and “complex.” Transitional groups between these two types are quite rare. It is also noted that population pressure does not arise in continental climates where famine mortality is common because of high-amplitude changes in productivity from year to year. It is argued that population pressure is a necessary and sufficient condition for and the efficient cause of socioeconomic complexity. The widespread disavowal by archaeologists of population pressure as a possible explanation for the prehistoric development of complex hunter-gatherers has no basis in ethnographic fact.

Complex social systems, compared with simple social systems, are those in which individuals frequently interact in many different contexts with many different individuals, and often repeatedly interact with many of the same individuals in networks over time. Complex communicative systems, compared with simple communicative systems, are those that contain a large number of structurally and functionally distinct elements or possess a high amount of bits of information. Here, we describe some of the historical arguments that led to the social complexity hypothesis, and review evidence in support of the hypothesis. We discuss social complexity as a driver of communication and possible causal factor in human language origins. Finally, we discuss some of the key current limitations to the social complexity hypothesis—the lack of tests against alternative hypotheses for communicative complexity and evidence corroborating the hypothesis from modalities other than the vocal signalling channel.},

Prior to the fourth century C.E., Indian trade activities with Southeast Asia appear to have been relatively infrequent, when assessed through the number of items of Indian origin recovered, and the incentives for such trade from the Indian point of view. After the fourth century, the adoption of subcontinental traditions-religious iconography, Sanskrit terminology, coinage, and terms identifying leaders-is seen throughout the area of Southeast Asia, from Bangladesh to Cambodia, Malaysia and Thailand as well as the larger Indonesian islands. Subcontinental traditions became attractive at this time because of the advent of strong political entities in the Indian subcontinent, notably the Guptas, which produced coherent models of political, social and religious organization. Although such models were also available from neighboring China, apprehension about Chinese expansion led the rulers of emergent chiefdoms in Southeast Asia to prefer the adoption of Indian political and religious iconography.},

  abstract = {The societies of southern Central America and northern South America, a region historically occupied by Chibchan-speaking peoples, have long been acknowledged as valuable sources of information on chiefdoms and other forms of prestate social organization. Most studies, however, have focused on chiefdoms that are known ethnographically or ethnohistorically with an emphasis on the sixteenth century and the immediate precontact period. This paper reviews archaeological evidence from an earlier period in an attempt to elucidate general patterns associated with the earliest appearance of social inequality. The centuries between AD 300 and 600 are characterized by the first widespread use of prestige goods manufactured from gold and jade, special cemeteries for the interment of elites, and a rich iconography. Detailed consideration of recent research relevant to the events of this period highlights some of the problems inherent in the archaeological identification of hierarchy, chiefdoms, leadership, and other features of prestate complex societies.},

Through shifting portrayals of identity and changes in the mortuary record, it is possible to highlight developments in the sociopolitical landscape over time and between regions. Employing a rigorous methodological approach, new analytical techniques—specifically, spatial and temporal analysis using GIS—and applying carefully constructed theoretical perspectives, this approach can bring a much-needed nuance to age-old questions about the complexities of the island's sociopolitical development during the Iron Age, 1100–312 B.C. The focus of this paper lies on the extensive yet complex mortuary remains of the Iron Age. Questions of to whom the burial record speaks, and how, are central to our grasp of social complexity, power interactions, and regional development of the Iron Age political territories. Detailed studies of Amathus and Salamis explore these themes and offer nuanced insights into the sociopolitical trajectories of individual polities, their territories, and the island as a whole.},

Documentary sources indicate that there was extensive change in socio-political institutions, economic relations, and other aspects of Gold Coast society in the centuries following the advent of European trade in the late fifteenth century. Archaeological survey and excavation of some 30 structures at Elmina similarly indicates a great deal of change in construction technology and material culture during the post-European contact period. However, examination of artefact patterning and associations indicates that in certain respects there was little change in terms of people's shared world view and belief systems. This picture can be contrasted with data from sites in other areas which may have experienced a great deal of culture change during the post-European contact period. /// Cet article examine brièvement les conséquences de la présence européenne sur la Côte de l'Or, se penchant plus particulièrement sur les données archéologiques, ethnographiques et historiques du site d'Elmina au Ghana. Les sources documentaires indiquent qu'un changement de grande envergure affectant les institutions socio-politiques, les relations économiques et d'autres aspects de la société de la Côte de l'Or pris place durant les siècles suivant l'arrivée du commerce européen à la fin du quinzième siècle. Un survey archéologique et les fouilles d'environ 30 structures à Elmina, indiquent aussi qu'un changement étendu des techniques de construction et de la culture matérielle s'effectue après la période de contact européen. Toutefois, l'étude de la distribution et des associations des objets, indique que le système de croyance et l'idée du monde partagée par cette société furent peu affectés. Cette image peut être comparée avec les données obtenues sur d'autres sites ayant fait l'expérience d'un changement culturel important pendant la période postérieure aux contacts européens.},

  title = {Apprenticeship, cultural transmission and the evolution of cultural traditions in historic New England gravestones},
  abstract = {Cultural evolutionary models that relate spatial and temporal patterning in artifact sequences to human social learning processes and history have made many recent advances. Specifically, these models connect evolutionary forces and social leaning mechanisms along cultural pathways with expectations that can be assessed using material culture. In this dissertation, I use an historical archaeology case study of carved New England gravestones to evaluate three different aspects of cultural transmission and artifact patterns. First, I study the role of social network structure in the transmission of cultural information among carvers organized in workshops that were principally comprised of a carver and his apprentices. The results of this study suggest that the motifs reflect widespread similarity that transcends workshop organization. However, the finer grained decorative elements that make up these motifs correspond with cultural lineages of gravestone carvers. Second, I examine the relationship between the diffusion of innovations and cultural transmission mechanisms that result in spatiotemporal patterning. The spatial patterning suggests that social contagion among consumers created brief instances of wave-like diffusion from a distinct workshop, highlighting the role of consumer choice. A review of probate payments shows that gravestones were rarely purchased from distance sources, as transport costs could be prohibitive. The spatial patterning and historic record suggest that carvers also learned from other carvers creating a hierarchical diffusion process. These two populations created a feedback mechanism that leads to complex emergent phenomena, as illustrated by the rapid and widespread adoption of the cherub motif. Third, the neutral model of stylistic variation is applied to gravestone data to examine the ways that increased consumption and an expanding carving industry led to dominant decorative motifs. This study shows that neutrality can be a fleeting and transitional state between the dominance of single decorative styles. These three studies use New England gravestones to illustrate the evolutionary forces and cultural transmission mechanisms among artifact producers and consumers, which generated the stylistic patterning we observe in the archaeological record.},

  volume = {33},
  abstract = {In a series of publications, Prentiss et al. (2003, 2005, 2007, 2008) have argued for a very late, abrupt, and brief emergence of large villages and large corporate residences in the mid-Fraser region of British Columbia ( 1600-800 cal B.P.) and an even later abrupt emergence of socioeconomic complexity ( 1200-800 cal B.P.). They postulate that climatic changes were responsible for both of these events as well as the collapse of the large villages. We question their interpretations on several grounds including: inappropriate methods for dating these developments; data from Keatley Creek indicating a longer developmental trajectory; incomplete interpretation of paleoclimate trends for the region; and internal contradictions in their own climate-driven explanations for changes. The combined evidence of geochronology and paleoecology (some not previously considered) together with archaeological evidence favors an interpretation of earlier emergence of large villages and socioeconomic complexity than suggested by Prentiss et al. (2003, 2005, 2007, 2008). Dans une série d'articles, Prentiss et al. (2003, 2005, 2007, 2008) ont proposé que les grands villages et les grandes résidences de la partie centrale du fleuve Fraser (en Colombie Britannique) se sont formés assez tardivement dans la préhistoire (c. 1600-800 cal B.P.) et n'ont duré que quelques siècles. Selon eux l'inégalité socioéconomique s'est développée encore plus tard (c. 1200-800 cal B.P). Prentiss et al. suggèrent que les changements climatiques seraient a l'origine de ces événements ainsi que de la disparition des grands villages. Nous doutons de leurs conclusions sur plusieurs plans: des méthodes inappropriées pour déterminer la date de ces événements; des données provenant du site Keatley Creek qui indiquent un développement de plus longue durée; des interprétations paléoclimatiques qui sont incomplètes; et des contradictions au sein de leurs explications climatiques pour les changements culturels. Les preuves géochronologiques et paléoécologiques (comprenant des données jamais considérées auparavant) combinées aux preuves archéologiques favorisent l'interprétation du développement des grands villages et témoignent d'une complexité socioéconomique bien antérieure à celle envisagée par Prentiss et al. (2003, 2005, 2007,2008).},

  abstract = {Ecosystems are complex and difficult to predict and control. Western science-based societies have tended to simplify ecosystems to manage them. Some indigenous and other rural groups who interact closely with a given resource system seem to have developed practices that are adapted to live with complexity. This paper examines how indigenous Cree hunters in James Bay, subarctic Canada, understand and deal with ecological complexity and dynamics, and how their understanding of uncertainty and variability shape subsistence activities. The focus is the Canada goose (Branta canadensis) hunt which is adaptive to shifts and changes in local and regional conditions. Ecological understandings of Cree hunters allow them to account for and deal with a very large number of variables at multiples scales. The Cree deal with these variables qualitatively, an approach consistent with some scientific ways of dealing with complexity, such as adaptive management and fuzzy logic.},

  abstract = {The major tenet of this paper is that mortuary behavior is a vehicle of social and political change leading to a heightened awareness of identity at death. Through shifting portrayals of identity and changes in the mortuary record, it is possible to highlight developments in the sociopolitical landscape over time and between regions. Employing a rigorous methodological approach, new analytical techniques—specifically, spatial and temporal analysis using GIS—and applying carefully constructed theoretical perspectives, this approach can bring a much-needed nuance to age-old questions about the complexities of the island's sociopolitical development during the Iron Age, 1100–312 B.C. The focus of this paper lies on the extensive yet complex mortuary remains of the Iron Age. Questions of to whom the burial record speaks, and how, are central to our grasp of social complexity, power interactions, and regional development of the Iron Age political territories. Detailed studies of Amathus and Salamis explore these themes and offer nuanced insights into the sociopolitical trajectories of individual polities, their territories, and the island as a whole.},

  abstract = {The societies of southern Central America and northern South America, a region historically occupied by Chibchan-speaking peoples, have long been acknowledged as valuable sources of information on chiefdoms and other forms of prestate social organization. Most studies, however, have focused on chiefdoms that are known ethnographically or ethnohistorically with an emphasis on the sixteenth century and the immediate precontact period. This paper reviews archaeological evidence from an earlier period in an attempt to elucidate general patterns associated with the earliest appearance of social inequality. The centuries between AD 300 and 600 are characterized by the first widespread use of prestige goods manufactured from gold and jade, special cemeteries for the interment of elites, and a rich iconography. Detailed consideration of recent research relevant to the events of this period highlights some of the problems inherent in the archaeological identification of hierarchy, chiefdoms, leadership, and other features of prestate complex societies.},

This article examines the conceptual foundation of archaeological “culture contact” studies by sharpening the terminological and interpretive distinction between “contact” and “colonialism.” The conflation of these two terms, and thereby realms of historical experience, has proven detrimental to archaeologists’ attempts to understand indigenous and colonial histories. In light of this predicament, the article tackles three problems with treating colonialism as culture contact: (1) emphasizing short-term encounters rather than long-term entanglements, which ignores the process and heterogeneous forms of colonialism and the multifaceted ways that indigenous people experienced them; (2) downplaying the severity of interaction and the radically different levels of political power, which does little to reveal how Native people negotiated complex social terrain but does much to distance “contact” studies from what should be a related research focus in the archaeology of African enslavement and diaspora; and (3) privileging predefined cultural traits over creative or creolized cultural products, which loses sight of the ways that social agents lived their daily lives and that material culture can reveal, as much as hide, the subtleties of cultural change and continuity.},

  title = {Emergence of Complex Society in Prehistoric Korea},
  volume = {6},
  abstract = {A highly stratified society had emerged in the Korean peninsula by the beginning of the Christian era. It was expressed symbolically by ownership of valued goods and status burials. Four factors are basic to understanding the emergence of stratification in prehistoric Korea, around 2300–1700 B.P.: autonomous sociocultural evolution within the peninsula since early Chulmun Period, external pressures from more advanced culture spheres in Manchuria and northern China, the existence of elites able to facilitate integrative process, and warfare and conflict. The external pressures, in particular, resulted in a sociocultural process characterized as a secondary formation. For the evidence of emerging social complexity and stratification, the authors examine various archaeological data, with a special focus on differentiated mortuary architecture and its associated objects. Ancient Chinese accounts are considered as complementary evidence.},

Using case studies from Australia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea and Micronesia, the contributors all share a concern with tracking the processes of contact between indigenous peoples and outsiders, primarily Europeans, across the varied physical and cultural landscapes of the region. Rock art sites, museum collections, surface sites, stratified shell middens and rock shelters as well as mission sites are used to examine the processes of interaction and negotiation between indigenous people and outsiders."–BOOK JACKET.},

"The case studies used range from the pyramids of Old Kingdom Egypt to illicit whisky distilling in nineteenth-century Scotland, and from the Roman roads of Turkey to the threshing floors of Cyprus under British colonial rule. Dr. Given uses the archaeological evidence to create a vivid picture of how the lives and identities of farmers, artisans and labourers were affected by colonial systems of oppressive taxation, bureaucracy, forced labour and ideological control.". "This is the first book to integrate fully the archaeological study of the landscape with the concerns of colonial and postcolonial history, theory and scholarship. It will be valuable to anyone investigating the relationship between local community and central control in a wide range of historical and archaeological contexts."–BOOK JACKET.},

The vocational focus that has evolved in the two perspectives, the conceptual frameworks and methods used for the study of social interactions and their interlinking in relational networks, presents aspects of extreme differentiation that render a possible convergence quite difficult.},

Claire Lyons and John Papadopoulos summarize the complex issues addressed by this collection of essays. Four case studies illustrate the use of archaeological artifacts to reconstruct social structures. They include ceramic objects from Mesopotamian colonists in fourth-millennium Anatolia; the Greek influence on early Iberian sculpture and language; the influence of architecture on the West African coast; and settlements across Punic Sardinia that indicate the blending of cultures. The remaining essays look at the roles myth, ritual, and religion played in forming colonial identities. In particular, they discuss the cultural middle ground established among Greeks and Etruscans; clothing as an instrument of European colonialism in nineteenth-century Oceania; sixteenth-century Andean urban planning and kinship relations; and the Dutch East India Company settlement at the Cape of Good Hope"–Publisher's description.},

Self-organized critical systems are large, interactive systems that organize into a critical state where minor events can trigger chain reactions. Such systems demonstrate power-law distributions in the size of changes, or "avalanches," that occur. The theory of self-organized criticality is important in that it implies that the evolution of complex systems may be driven more by interactions between agents than by external events or natural selection. Stylistic changes may be examples of avalanches of interconnected events. Evidence for self-organized criticality is shown for stylistic evolution in historical pottery styles from New York State and is used to evaluate the nature of a prehistoric pottery typology from the Southwest.},

The vocational focus that has evolved in the two perspectives, the conceptual frameworks and methods used for the study of social interactions and their interlinking in relational networks, presents aspects of extreme differentiation that render a possible convergence quite difficult.},

In some cases these choices explicitly communicate a message; in others, patterned behaviors may result in a kind of technological style that can be used to make inferences about the manufacturer's identities. Investigation of bone tools from the Chiggerville, Read, and Baker sites in the Green River region of western Kentucky has resulted in the identification of four distinct methods of manufacturing single-piece fishhooks. Additionally, small pointed implements may represent the barbs of composite fishhooks, indicating the use of a technologically distinct fifth style. These fishhook types are interpreted as evidence for the movement of individuals throughout the mid-South in the process of social interaction and exchange and support the hypothesis that Shell Mound Archaic groups in western Kentucky were complex hunter-gatherers.},

Skills are studied by reference to present-day bead knapping in Khambhat, India. They are examined from the way actors are able to handle the complexity of the task and achieve it. They are analyzed in terms of learning difficulties and duration of apprenticeship. The methodology followed is proper to the psychological field. It enables us to understand, in particular, the necessary long apprenticeship required for knapping long beads whatever the culture in which it takes place. It follows that Harappan long carnelian beads are interpreted on the one hand as made by highly skilled craftsmen who developed specialized skills for a very limited demand, on the other hand as highly valuable.},

  abstract = {Skills involved in the knapping of Harappan long carnelian beads are studied in order to assess their value as well as knappers' socio-economic status. Skills are studied by reference to present-day bead knapping in Khambhat, India. They are examined from the way actors are able to handle the complexity of the task and achieve it. They are analyzed in terms of learning difficulties and duration of apprenticeship. The methodology followed is proper to the psychological field. It enables us to understand, in particular, the necessary long apprenticeship required for knapping long beads whatever the culture in which it takes place. It follows that Harappan long carnelian beads are interpreted on the one hand as made by highly skilled craftsmen who developed specialized skills for a very limited demand, on the other hand as highly valuable.},
